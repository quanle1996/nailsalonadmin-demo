## Install PostgreSQL

WSL (ie. Ubuntu):
Open your WSL terminal (ie. Ubuntu).
Update your Ubuntu packages:
`sudo apt update`

Once the packages have updated, install PostgreSQL (and the -contrib package which has some helpful utilities) with:
`sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

Enter the command: `sudo passwd postgres`
You will get a prompt to enter your new password.
Close and reopen your terminal.
To run PostgreSQL with psql shell:
Start your postgres service: `sudo service postgresql start`
